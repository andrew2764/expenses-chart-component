## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [How To Make Tooltips With Only CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujlpzTyJp-M) - This was my first time writing a tooltip from scratch. I followed this tutorial from Web Dev Simplified. It helped immensely and also helped me get more familiar with using CSS pseudo elements

- [CSS Grid Course](https://cssgrid.io/) - I used CSS grid to implement the layout of the bar charts. I initially was not familiar with it, so I went through this course by Wes Bos to get myself up to speed.
